A simple Flask-based web application to browse books, add them to a cart, and view the cart. This project features a clean UI with support for book images, uses a SQLite database, and Flask-Session for managing user sessions.

## Features
- **Books Page**: View a list of books with images, titles, and authors.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add books to a cart and view them in a dedicated cart page.
- **Database**: Uses `SQLite` for storing book details.
- **Session Management**: `Flask-Session` is used for persistent cart data.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with a responsive grid layout)
- **Session Management**: Flask-Session
- **Virtual Environment**: Python venv

## Getting Started
